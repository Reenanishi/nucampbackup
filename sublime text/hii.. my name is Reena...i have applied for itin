 hii.. my name is Reena...i have applied for itin number in month of june along with that i have sent copy of my document attested by authorized irs officer then

I got a letter form IRS ITIN department saying that i should send my original passport to them. So i sent my passport in month of October. and USPS tracking number confirmed that IRS received it..
then on jan 1st i have recieved ITIN rejection letter that says it being rejected because I have not sent the original identification document that they requested!

 i called irs several times ..last time they told me that the letter i got was a auto generated one and i have to wait for 11 weeks.. now it has been  more than 11 weeks
